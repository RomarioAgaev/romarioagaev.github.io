The soft whisper of rain on the leaves was singing an autumn ode, inviting to oblivion and detachment from the earthly world. It was at that very moment when Jack realised his nature and liberated it into the wild. The old Jack has never been seen again…",

We've worked hard to come up with a design that will make it easier for users to switch between cards and accounts. When users switch to the payment screen, they see a circle with photos or company logos of people and companies they interact with most often. By clicking on a photo or logo, a list of recent transactions will open. To switch cards or accounts, users can swipe or simply open the entire list. After a successful transaction, we suggest creating a template for future payments.",
